have introduced from 11 into the body 01 my edition only one emcnda-
tion, 11111111 for pestem in 449, which I had left uncorrected: to the rest
01 the program Ι have devoted a separate appendix. The learned and
accomplished critic hus had the 111-11111111 get a most inaccurate collation
010..

. The manuscripts which I denote by c, β, γ, δ, r, t respectively have
been fully described above: as I have already said, the minutest varia
11011101 c have been recorded ; as well. as the readings of the lost frag-
ment β, so far 11 a comparison 01 the two authorities on which I had to
rely permittcd this to be done: where it did not seem worth while to
give in detail the variatione 01 γ, 8, ε and 1, o denotas either all 01 thess,
together with the editions before Aldus so far as they were known to me,
unless any of these mss. are especially exceptod 3 or else the general con-
sensus of the best and most important 01 them: 6· designatos some or all
of the later and worse of these inferior mss, and editions: Ed denotas
the present editor.

both'speaking of Aetna: Lucr. 11214 ‘abrupti nubibus ignes’‚ with
which Macrobius compares Aen. 111 199 ‘abruptis nubibus igncs’ where
Ribbeck's G has abrupti, Macrobius giving abruptio 10 Lucretius
