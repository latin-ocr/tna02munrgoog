‘ gniltless ol plunder': the sense wanted seems to be ‘unharmed’, which
lauccio can by itseli have. I regret not to be able to throw more light
on this paragraph ; but, assisted by s, I have not treated it like other
editors, who with all their violent emendations, seem none of them, not
oven Scaliger, to connect lt rationally with what precedes and follows
ets-424: whether tho cause then come from without or from
within, eruptione oi fire, saud, stenes and molten rocks are frequent:
material never fails: ifthere is 6 1611, it is ilum the openings being
blocked up ; and when this resistance is broken through, the emption
is rendered more violent: many mineral substances help ; but above all
the lapis molaris or lava-stone foeda the eruption: its power of retaining
fire is very great 5 and it cau be rekindled again 666 again. 356 pere·
prinu: the causes last spoken of which he admits to be possible ; but
not sc likely as the propriae, the inter-nal causes, described before.
potentie is the nom. pluat see n. to 56 discordet. 360 portione of the
mountain are carried up in the form of showcrs of send, so prominent a
feature in all emptione and spoken of abore: comp. too 344 ‘Qui rupes
terramque rotat’: the terrorve is those ‘montis partes'. 361 srayorrb
I take for the accus. plur: Seneca epist 95 63 ‘fragores bellorum ciui·
lium; dial.1310 ‘aquarum fragoribus’: the acoris -ic is common in
words of a similar formation, laboris, amrbrrh, etc: see Ribbeck proleg.
Verg. p. 406 and my n 6616666591. 363 fulmine I keep, as fiae

mino for the streame of lava would seem to be too abrupt: comp. 344
‘qui fulminat ignes’3 Petron. 122 6135 ‘iamque Aetna noratur Ignibus ;

insolitis et in aethera fulmina mittit‘ 3 and Sennat quaest1130 ‘Aetna
aliquando multo igne abundauit, ingentem uim harenae urentis effudit. .. ’
1116 ternpore aiunt tune plurima firisse tonitrua et fulmina, quae con-
cursu aridorum corporum facta sunt, non nubium cet’: and fragores can
well go together with submitto: comp. Senmet. quaest. 11273 ‘talia

4 times 66661666, twice bracchia. 373 operae Scaliger takes for the

I am not sure that it is not the dat. sing. 373 rumput=interrum

and the like: 666 my n. to Luer.111820. 376 tecto is in apposition
with 666 pondere: I have emended the next v. as the sense seems to
require, and less harshly I think than former editors: but as our mss
so often put 6 for r, as 344 ‘notat’, 469 ‘notant’, 445 ‘adgeneret’, 448 l
