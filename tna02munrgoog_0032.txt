did 1101 understand it, until I had written down at length in what way
I proposed to explain it This I hope will be found 10 be nottho least
useful portion 01 this small work

Our poem is found in some only of the earlier editions 01 Virgil‚·
and these appear tc have all essentially the same text, having been
printed no doubt one from the 011101. I have before me two editions of
1475, Rubeus' dated J anuary 01 that year and Ienson’s, both belonging
10 0111 Trinity library: their texts 010 throughout the same in all hut
quite unimportant points, except that Ienson in 514 has, probably from
conjecture, the correct manuscript reading 10010, while Rubeus and
I believe ’011 other early editions have 00010. These then I have deemed
amply sufficient to represent the whole class, since, 00 might be expected
in 00 corrupt 0 poem, they follow the text of a late and very interpolated
manuscript. Our poem first appears in agreatly correcmd form in the
Aldine edition 01 the catalecta and other minor poems dated December
1517. This and the second Aldine of March 1534111010 had before mc, Ι
and have found them both most useful in determining the history 010111
text: the secondis mostly 0 reprint of the first 3 but yet has a good
many important variaticns fremit and in not a few cases is the first so
far as I know to offer a correct text. Once Ι have found the right
reading first in Gryphius'edition of 1547. But scon 011 other editions
were to be superseded by Scaliger's Virgilii appendix, printed at Lyons
in 1572 and published in that or the following year: of two copies
before me one, Duport's, from our Trinity library has on the title-page
1572 3 the other 1573, which 'appears 10 be thc usual date. A second

- edition was published at Leyden in 1595111111 some changes and

additional remarks by Scaliger and the editor Lindenbrucln Anything
coming 110111 Scaliger must display learning, power and originality; and
I donet think that any work 01 his cn the Latin poets 1100 these
qualitics in a-higher degree than his notes on the Aetna Its grem
difficulty put him on his mettle ; its poetry too had for him 0 singular
attraction: following the older Italian authorities, not the more cautious
Aldine editor, he attributed it to Ovid's friend Cornelius Severus and

· therefore to the age of Augustus 01 Tiberius: ‘quo neque post tempora

ἱ Tiberii Caesaris cultius poema neque mendosius ullum ad nos peruenit '‚

ἵ he says at the end of his 110100. The latter clause is true enough, the
former he will find few to approve. As is often seen in vigorous batere,
his antipathy ’10 Lucan made him contrast our poet favourably with
fieti pingues Cordubenses poetae, Musarum tmpcipnra’. He set himself
therefore earnestly 01 work to correct and explain our poem. Having
besides the printed editions only one late and interpolated manuscript,
he must often from the nature 01 the case go wide astray. Yet in not
a few instances with the glauce 01 genius he descries the truth through
