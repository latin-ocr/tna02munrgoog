as though ir never had been. The third passage is537f011. where the
poet recommends the ‘verissima dicta’ of Heraclitus' obscure book, thar
fire was the end of all things and the clement of all things: his subse·
quenl imitatione of lhe language of Lucretius no more shew him ιο ‘be
an epicurean, than the many close imitatione of the same writer hythe
sloic Manilius prove ie of him If then Lucilius was an epicurean when
our poem was written, he did not write ἱι. Itis with reference mainly
ιο this peina rhet I have gone through Seneea's letters I will give a
summary of the results I have obtained: if I were ιο state the evidence
al length, I should heve ιο fill many peges with extracta.

Lucilius appears ιο have been a man of literary and philosophical
hastos, given ιο much and multifaricus reading: epist. 2 2 ‘illudentem
uide ne isia lectio auctorum mullorum οι omnis generis uoluminum
habeat aliquid uagum οι instabile': without as yet a fixed creed‚ but -
anxious ιο have one; ready ιο be convinced by the arguments of Seneca,
and accepling much of what he lays down, bui scill, as we can see from ·
ihe very last of Seneca’s letters, refusing ιο accept some of the most ex-
treme stoice] paradoxes. Thai during any period of their correspond-
ence Lucilius wass professed epicurean, Ido not believe: even in the
earliest letters Seneca often speaks of Epicurus and his sect, as he could
hardly have done ιο an intimate friend who was at the same time a
deeided epicurean. Yet from several indicatione it would appear that
Lucilius was favourably inclined ιο this school: once, episi. 23 9, Seneca
writes ‘vocem tibi Epicuri tui reddere’: compare the ‘Ouidius huus’
already spoken oi: in lhe lorch epistle we have ‘Epicurus noster’: ihe
esth epislle ιοο has more than one expression, indicaling some relation

’ between Lucilius and Epicurus. Bul all thiais very far from showing

thar Lucilius was a professed believer in Fpicmus 3 and indeed from lirsi
ιο last Seneca writes in a way thal seems ιο me ιο contradici such a
supposition: no epicurean could have held the doctrines about provi-
dence, the gods etc. which Seneca attributes ιο his friend even at the
beginning of their correspondenee. Ιι seems clear enough then thal
Lucilius was, like many of his countrymcn, an ecleciic, with a dislaste
for the iren consisteney of the Greek speculative spirit 3 finding much
ιο approve and something ιο dislike in each of che rival schools of Epi-
curus and the Perrh, then ibe moal popular systema in Rome. Seneca
himself shruuk from some of the extremest stoical paradoxes and owed
much ιο the more human and humane ieaching of Epicurus. We leam
from Gellius thala there were al least two more books of Seneca’s letters
ιο Lucilius 3 bui at the end of the twenty extant Lucilius is still a
doubier of the truths of stoicism. However it is possible enough lhae
further reflexion and the subsequens deam of Seneca may have produced
full conviciion in the genereus spirit of Lucilius. If then there was
