noete γ 8 ε. This εὴ is a very fnutful source of corruption: I believe
for instance that in Propert. 111 (Π) 34 53 we should read ‘Neo si post
Stygias aliquid rest (i. e. re θεὴ) arbiter undas': comp. ‘Sunt aliquid
manes’ and the like. Probably in many cases where our mss. now give
θεὴ in full, our author wrote εὴ, asin 19 instanoes in which θεὴ now
occurs at the endof a verse ; as well as in no less than 38 instenoes
where a vowel or an m is elided before θεὴ by our mss. in other parts οἳ
the verse If the poet did not always ιθτίὴθ the enclitic et, hc probably
meant us so to pronounce, as in most of these cases en elision would not be
admissible according to his principles of versification which are mostly
Ovidian‚ the prevailing fashion in his age. Thus while que or other
instances of ἔ are freely elided‚ »more than 100 times 3 he is much more
. ohary in eliding d or a syllable ending in m, and in the whole poem
there are hardly more than 20 cases of the elision oia long vowel; and
in these lest as well as those of d and m a very large proportior of the
elisione occur between the first and 2αο foot or in the middle of the leh,
where to our estosed that of the ancients such elisione sonnded less
harsh then elsewhere In other ceses the elision was designed to pro·
duce some particular effect· ρναὴὴονε Mart 1v 44 5 ‘Haec Veneris sedes

Ηρὴα is the seme thing as the ι’ὴα ol α, ὴΙιθ aspirete then and long
before being nothing and ρ and i being interchangeable: thus 49 eliwa-

Virgil p. 422 423, 427, 452 and the authorities he cites: α writes
throughout θιὴΙιιια and ιιθὴΙυιιιθιιε. For Hyla compare Stephanus Bya
e. v. Ὕλη, πόλις Κύπρου ἓν ἦ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται Ὑλότης. Λυκόφρων [448]
καὶ Σότραχον βλώξαντες Ὑλότου τε γῆνε where the sohelisst says Ὺλό-
του· τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος· Ὕλη γὰρ ἐστὶ περὶ τόν Κούριον, τόπον τῆς Κύπρου,
ἱερὰ Ἀπόλλωνος, ἀφ’ ἧς Ὺλότην τόν θεόν προσαγορεύουσαι Eusteth. Il.
E708 ἦν δέ φασι καὶ Αοκρικῆ πόλις Ὕλη, καὶ ἄλλη Κόπρου ἀφ’ ἧς καὶ
‘rueme Ἀπόλλων παρὰ Αυκόφρονι. These passages Ι quote et length,
because they are the only ones I know where this ’Υλη is mentioned by
neme; though Strabo p. 683 alludes ὴο the same worship: εἶτα πόλις
Κοόριον ὅρμον ἔχουσα, Ἀργείων κτίσμα ἤδη οὖν πόρεσπι σκοπεῖν τὴν
ρᾳθυμίαν τοῦ ποιήσαντος τό ἐλεγεῖον τοῦτο οὗ ἡάρχὴ Ἱραὶ τῷ Φοίβῳ
πολλόν tel κῦμα θέουσαι Ἢλθορεν αἱ ταχιναὶ τόξα φυγεῖν ἔλαφοι. εἶθ’
