η admirabilis fuit3 siquidem mater eius laodicaeam nupta esset Antio-

cho claro inter Philippi duces uiro, uisa sibi est per quietem ex concu-
bitu Apollinis concepisse grauidamque factam cet. Ubi post mortem
Alexandri occupato regno orientis urbem condidit, ibi quoque geminae
originis memoriam consecrauit. nam et urbem ex Antiochi patris
nomine Antiochiam uocauit et campos uicinos Apollini dicauit'. Seleu-

, cus in 300 ac. founded at the same time Antioch, which (lhrysostom a

native proudly terms the κεφαλή καὶ μήτηρ of all the cities of the east,
and at fija miles distance, higher up the Orontes, the park and sanctuary
of Daphne which (lhrysostom, Ammian and others so often calla suburb
of Antioch. Daphne was no less famous than Antioch, which on coins,
in inscriptions and books is as often called Antioch by Daphne, Antioch
of Daphne, as Daphne is termed Daphne by Antioch: καὶ πάντα ἦνῆ
Δάφνη Σελεύκῳ, says Libanins in his Antioohicus chrysostom, while
invidiously contresting the earthly Daphne with the heavenly Jerusar
lem, cannot conceal what charms it had for the children ol this world.

Το Anticch and Daphne was transplanted the whole worship of Apollo: “
unable to create, the Syrien Greeks brought hither the very names .

of old Hellas, (laetalia and the like: an omphalos, far larger than that of
Delphi, was set up by Antiochus Epiphanes or Epimenes in the middle
tetrastylon of his great centra] street of colonnades Ausonius, de clar.
urb. 3, says ‘Phoebeae lauri demus Antiochia'

But on the banks of the Oronteleaphne was always called daughter
of Ladon: nay the very river was mansferred to Syria, like Castalia
Whyl was Laodice connected w'rth the Peloponneso and the parts of it
where the Ladon flowedl Much else was brought from thence to Syria
On the hill Silpion was an old Syrien Ione, on which Seleucus Nicator
sacnficed to Zeus (leraunius in the spi-ing of 300, before founding
Antioch. This gave rise to the notion of an Argiue-Athenian colony
sent to recover Io, and to other tasteless perversione of the genuine my-
thology. Ladon isa fine river, but not better than twenty others in the
‘great Dorian island of Pelops'3 and in the unperverted legend was
known as father of Metope famous in the mythical history of Thebes
and Hellas: see Pindar olymp. v1 and his scholiast, and Diodorus 1v 72.
Even in Ovid and Hyginus we know Daphne only as daughter of
Peneus. But Antioch changed all this: Pausaniasw11201 thus writes:
ά δὲ Λάδων ποταμῶν τῶν ἓν Ἑλλάδι ὕδωρ παρέχεται κάλλιστον, ἔχει δὲ καὶ
ἄλλος ἒς άνθριίπους φήμην καὶ τοὶ ᾀδόμενα ἒς τήν Δάφνην. τοῦ λόγου δὲ
τοῦ ἐς Δάφνην τά μὲν Συρίοις τοῖς οἰκοῦσιν ἐπὶ Ὀράνπη ποταμῷ παρίημι
- παλ What was told by the Syrians on the Orontesl Philostratus in
his life of Apolloniusl 16 p. 19 will throw some light on this: ἑπεφοίτησε
καὶ Ἀντιοχείᾳ τῇ μεγάλῃ πεπαυμένος τοῦ σιωπᾶν, καὶ παρῆλθεν ἐς τά ίερδν
rod Δαφναίου Ἀπόλλωνος, ᾧ περιάπτουσιν Ἀσσύριοι πδν μῦθον πδν Ἀρκάδα·
