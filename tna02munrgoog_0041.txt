passed over thie far more pertinent source oi illustration and comparison.
Our poem then was written before 7 9, and as Ι cannot anyhow believe
it tc he older than the silver ege, ite time would exactly tally with the

ἵ tiine ol Lucilius. The poem too is evidently written by one who was

well acquaintod with Etna and its neighbourhood, and had seen its
eruptione and their consequences: now Lucilius was long governor of
Sicily. Ifind too more than one indication that the writer had a
practical knowledge of war and public business. More than once in the
commenteryl have noted how fond he is of comparing the raveges of
Etna with those of an enemy. rho most curicus passage is rel-474,
which c first rendere intelligible: to the poet, a spectator of tho scene,
Etna suggests the notion of a victorious enemy¹ attaching the terrified

hystanders at the same time with missiles and at cloec quarters. The
picture looks as if drawn bya practieed observet· oi battles, not bye
mere clueat-poet. Now Lucilius would appear, as we said above, tc have
served under Lentulus Gaetulicus commender in Upper Germany, at
that time ona oi the beet sehools cf Romen war, where he might have
had many opportunities of eeeing the barbarione falling under the evonis
and missiles of the legions and strowing the field os battle in the manner

here described The curioue metaphor too in 27 8 268 259 etrikee me

moreover speaks as an eyewitness ci the neighbourhood of Naples3 and
Seneca talks to Lucilius-oi ‘Pompeios tuoe'‚ and ‘Parthenope tue’ ae if
Lucilius had eomc closo connexion with those parts All this ehaws of
course only thet ho might have been, not that he'was the author.
Besidss the passage about Etna in Seneca’s 7 9th epietle which we
have discussed above, Wernedors and Jacob to prove the author to be
Lucilius allege tho iact as they say that he was an epicurean and the
, writer of the poem was an epicursan. This question they treat with
grem carelessness and confusion cf thought: Jacob refers to no loss
than seven passages to prove that the poet was c follower of Epicurus..
Five of these merely advise you to use your eyes and senses in judging
of what ie going on 3 and this a etoic could do as well as an epicurcau 3
nay a believer in Zeno oi Elea, ae well as a partisan of Zeno cf Citium:
the other two passages directly disprove what he asserta Not tc dwell
on minor points, there are three passages in the poem, each distinctly
enuntiatinga leading stoica] doctrine: first, 33-35, where the divinity
of the stare is maintained: thie a peripatetio indeed might have held as
well as a stoic 3 certainly not an epicursan. The and passage is 173 174,
where the end of the present state cf things and the return cf the world
to ite original etate arc hinted at, in exact conformity with the tecching
of the stoica, in direct contradiction tc that oi Epicurus who taught that
