credas=credit aliquis: this use 01 110 201 pers sing. potential is ex-
tremely frequent in Latin: oomp. Madvig gram. 370, and my n. 1ο
Luor. 1 327 possis=possumns or potest aliquis, and 1141 Caua uideas:
uidemus or uidet aliquis: Madvig observes that this idiom is 01 very ex-

1010110100, employed alike 1111001101 clauses 01 sentences, or, as
here, after conjunctione, 01, cam, ete, or relatives: the imperi is so used
00 well as the present: Lucr. v 1332 and vr 1268 uideres, and possea
more than onoe: with this union 01 est and medas comp. Lucr. 11850 ‘ ,
‘Quoad lieet ao possis', where Lachmann’s potis cs 10 no more necessary
than Jacob’s credis here: the same idiom occurs below, 401 ‘si 10110
mann teneas ao.„cernas,...putes’, where Jacob quite spoils the passage
Ι by violent and useless changes: 1011100 and cerasos do not depend on si
forte, but: tenemus, cernimus. 309 Proraere seems quite necessary:
the saverne tumble in; and the air thus displaced rushes about and
101000 wind: 1110111545 ‘Snbter nbi ingentis speluncas submit aetas:
Quippe cadunt toti montes': this use 01 proruere appears in the silver
age: Tac ann. xv 22 ‘motu terrae...oppidum Pompei magna ex parte
proruit’. 310 masmae 01 a allays at once ‘certamina tanta' 01 editors,
Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdoff, Jacob. 311 effomdese, animas or auras:
it is curicus how he has dwelt and continues to dwell on this production
of air and wind from moisture. But in ahot elimate the difference in
temperatura between the air and running waters olten makes the
currente of air very perceptible. ³14 Flam. parua seem to 10 110
adai taken from the amnas and distributed 101 irrigation over the fields:
Pliny 111 119 ‘[Pedus] deductus in fiumina et fossas inter Rauennam
Altinumque’: Flamina appears 10 come from a misunderstanding 01 110
. passage. aia 10 harum aurarum, ί01110110 01 011 from water'.
315 ‘humor adspirat 101100 auras, et uerberibus impellit ', thus increosing
their force: Aen. v 607 ‘uentosque adspirat eunti’: bnt our passage 10
very obscurely expressed, 11 110 mss 010 right. sle ia 00100, ‘in the
open air’. 10100110 0 fine correction 01 J acob's: Lucretius uses it several
times 101 water 01 moisture generally: see my note 101496. 317
clusi: this form, to judge 11011 110 1001 mss, 01 Juvenal 101 instance
and Seneca, was common in the silver age. 318 pandas, ‘within the
earth,’ is opposed to 11111οε 110 word often occurs with this sense in our
poem: causae is nomin. 10 1109111011 110 same causes act on the winds
below; and being there pent up, these work with more fury: the notion
he again and again 00 elaboratelyinsists on. 320 acffocct, the passage
chokes the winde as they are thus fighting, and compels them to burst
out. 323 011011. cert. 10 much the same as Paqaaara sufficet. laag.
icto is illustrated by ‘primos ultimus urget’: one 1111111111 01111100 on
another, and so impels it onwards, as one ware another ware. 324
325 0110001 one v, has come from airas 01 110 01101; acommon error
