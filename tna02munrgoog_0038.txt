A few words have now to be said of the reputed authors of our
poem. It came down among the smaller works attributed to Virgil3
to whom it 10 assigned by our best 01000011 8100 simply ‘de 0100
monts' As it hes manifestly no claim whatever, less even than the
culex or ciris to be his work, I need 001 controvert what none will
now maintain. The name 01 ¹Cornelius Severus hes found more ac·

Virgil's name together with the words ‘a quibusdam (10000110 101101100’ 3
