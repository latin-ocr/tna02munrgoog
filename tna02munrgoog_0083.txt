if sacra be right, then the constr. must be ‘gemina ex uno sacra, fu-
mantia uapore’: a word for οααα, with the meaning of flammae or stopo
res, apices or uertices or eacumina, all used by the poete in reference to
this suble, would make the sentence simpler: this discord of the sons of
Oedipus even after death is also a commonplace of the poeta: Paus. rx

Tacitus aud other writers of the silver age, of a division or troop of
soldiers: Lycurgus suggests the mention of the Spartan army, one of
the creatione on which his fame rested 3 for Gorallus seems to be right
in saying that νιωινονιιε is the masolio, the kern of the Spartan system:
he quotes Hesychius, ἐνωμοτία· τάξις τις διὰ σφαγίων soporos ‚atra

sentence uictrice, in her contest with Neptune. 583, us told by

591 who is the ducis he‘re mentionedl is it Ajax whose tomb was and
is on the Rhoetean headlandl or Hectori or even Achillesl so that
what follows means, and not only the tomb of Achilles, but of Paris as

correction of his, shews that the Greek poets often speak of the θάλαττα

Oceanus as her father: the poet alludes 10 Apelles' picture of Venus
Anadyomene. 595 refers to the famous picture of Timomachus: ’
