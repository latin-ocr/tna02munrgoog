'AETNA

Fons elaborate editions of this short poem have appeared at very
different periods during the last three centurias, three of them extending
to hundreds of peges each: the other, first elika in time and merit
though of much less bulk than its successore, looks formidsble enough
when compared with the text which it illustratos. A few months ago
nothing was farther from my thoughts than this poem: towards the
end of last October Ι had the pleasure of collating for Professor Ribbeck
a manuscript of the Culex in our public library 3 and on finishing it I
looked through the Aetna which came after3 and soon found on oom-
paring it with Jacob’s edition that it surpeaeed other collated mann-

a complete collation of this codex and adding. from Jacob a digest

Breslau. At the same time 1 gave as minute an account as Ι could cf

examination of the two printed sources from which they are to be
gotter, both of which I had and have before me. Having further
ascertained that the British Museum contained two ¹manuscripts of our
poem Ι made an accurato collation of them in the month of Jannary.
From these sources are derived the various readings which appear below
my text. A fuller description of them shall be given after Ι have first
said a few words of the various editions which in forming my own I
have had the power or the will to consult The explanatory com·
mentary forms the largest part of my edition: something of the sort I
found to be necessary for my own satisfacffion, much of the poem being
so obscuro and so corrupt that often I could not tell whether Ι under·
stood what was before me, or, the next best thing, feel quite sure that Ι
