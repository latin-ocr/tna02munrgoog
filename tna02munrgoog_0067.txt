teclrnioal' involved description: but the clearest accounts are found in
Heronl. l. and in the 'curicus poem of Publil. optatianus ap. Wernsdorf
poet. min. 11 p. 405 where the arrangement and length of the vss sug-
gests to the eye the arrangement of the tubes: 41 ‘Perque modos gra
dibus surget fecunda canoris Aere cauo et tereti, calamis crescentibus
aucta Quis bene suppositis quadratis ordine plectris Artificis manus in
numeros clauditque aperitque Spiramenta’ will illustrate our v., and
’ wirnt follows ‘sub quibus unda latens properantibus incita uentis, Quae
uicibus crebris iuuenum labor cet', looks like 298, where mbr. unda
seems a reminiscence of Aenx227 ‘subremigat undis’: bnt the ‘arte
regentis Quae tenuem cet? must refer to the organist who is playing on

the keys and ,thus driving the air into the tubes so as to produce the ¹ ⁵

music: it would seem here simply to mean ‘ he rows along’, i. ο. plays on
the different keys, ‘by means oi the water’‚ which supplies the pressure
by which the air is forced into the tubes ; for all seem agreed that this
was the sole purpose oi the water: Heron p. 229 τὰδὲ ἔντῷβωμίσκῳ ὕδωρ
ἐμβάλλεται ἕνεκα τοῦ τᾶν περισσευόντα οἷὲρα ἒν τῷ πνιγεῖ, λέγω δὴ τᾶν ἐκ τῆς
πυξίδος ὠθούμενον ἐπαίροντα vd ὕδωρ apris τὸ ἀεὶ ἔχειν voris ciberis δυναμένους
φθέγγεσθαι : Athen. l. l. says ἔμπνευστᾶν 0 ἂν ἴσως ῥηθείη διὰ τὸ ἐμπνεῖσθαι
ed ὄργανον rimi redituros: he next goes on to describe how this is done.
Pliny however, rx 88, uses matremipo in its literal sense of rowing under·
neoth: can then the words imply here ‘ he rowe below upon the water’,
i. e. while heis playing above with his hands, he ismoving something
below with his feet, which sets the water in motioni 299 just in the
same way the wind of Etna maddened at being dislodged by the torrente
of water fights in the straitened room, and thus Etna roais mightily like
the bucina of the Triton, or the waterorgan, both like it moved by
water, summota fraena: see n. to ⁴67. 301 not only are there these
external causes of wind in Etna, but we must believe they are produced
below the earth from causes similar to those outsida 303 premam
is clearly right, ανοαοααι having no meaning here μνααααι inter ae is
the proper Latin construction in the sense of ‘mutuo premunt pre·
muntur': Lucr. vr 456 ‘comprendunt inter se'3 1 7 87 ‘ inter se mutare‘,
where I give instantes from (licere, Caesar and Livy. 305 tutaque
cet. must mean ‘and do not settle down until they are in a saie place':
but perhaps J acob’s ‘tuta dum sede' is necessary: with que in oi αα for Δ
clam, comp. 206 que cetra β rightly, dextra αο.

eoo-328: if even you contest what I say, you must allow that
rocks tumble underground, and so causo a dispersion of air, and produce
wind: also that the moisture of mists produces air and wind as we see
on meadows near a river: much greater is the power of water under
the earth, and of winde which by constraint are rendered more violent,
until they burst out with their lires from the crater of Etne. 307
