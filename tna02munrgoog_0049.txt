fluuium et montem Casium dicitur peruenisse atque ibi in cypressum
arborem commutatus'. Statius Theb 1v 289 ‘et qui tibi, Pythie, ladon
Paene socer' 3 837 ‘To nec Apollineus Iadon’. Galen in his decempes
media seo. locos 1, chapl near the end, vol. xrr p. 421-426 Kiihn,
describes a messe very efficaoious in enring baldncsa The recipe was
found after the owner‘s doeth, ἐν πυκτῶν διφθέραι it was written in
figurative language not easy to interpret Galen attempta this with
apparent suocess; but yet with regard to each of the other ingrediente
he will only say ‘I think it means eo and so'3 ae when he aeutely
explains ‘a pound of fat from a shapeless child’ to mean a pouud of
gressa srom a young beer before its mother had lieked it into ehape
One of the ingrediente however, p. 423, is λαδωνίδος φύλλον α’παλῶν
χυλοῦ, of whioh he says, p. 426, λαδωνῶος δὲ, ὅτι τῆς δάφνης λέγει, οὒκ ἂν
οἶμαί τινα διαπαρῆοοιτ so world-renowned at that time was the daughter
of Iadon By whom chiefly or when she got this renown I cannot tell:
perhaps πολλὰ ψεύδονται ἀοιδοί, was all that oould be said for the poete
of Antioch. The legend Ι doubt not was coeval with the foundation of
the city, and connected somehow with the family oi Seleucus But the
Museum of Antioch appears to have been of later eelebrity. Oicero, pro
Arabia 4³ speaking of this native of Antiooh says ‘se adscribendi
studium contulit, primum Antioohiae (nam ibi natus ast nobili loeo),
celebri quondam urbe et copiosa atque eruditissimis hominibus liberalis·
simisque studiis affluenti’. Archias among others may have helped to
give the story its grem celebrity: Ovid did not know or neglected this
formos tha legend. A comparison of the readings and comments of
Scaliger, (torellus, Wernsdorf and Jacob would Ι think commend mine'.
7 Pierio: Iam not sure that this hae not reference to Antioch
and Daphne: north of them and the Orontes was a district and a moun-
tain both named Pieria: Strabo p.. 749 Ἀντιόχεια ἤ ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ καὶ

Σελεύκεια ἡ ἐν Herpis: Pliny v 79 ‘dein promunturium Syriae Anti·
oohiaa intus ipsa Antiochia libera Epidaphnee cognominata Oronte

Strabo p. 751 πρὸς θαλάττῃ δὲ τούτων ἐστὶνῆ &taxea καὶ ἡ Πιερία, ὅρος ’
συνεχὲς τῷ Ἀμανιῖι Studes: it is strange so many0editions should
prefer the ill-attested cautius.

. 9-28: the golden age and the legendsof old timos have been sung
so often, that they are as familiar as our own times to us all I essay
something more real: to explain the morements and the fires of Etnae-
The thought in these wss is an expansionof the opening lines of the 3rd
georgic. 9 mouet: an epithet expressing the chief bleseing of the
golden aga 11 stenima: the furebas of t ς and all editionsis
