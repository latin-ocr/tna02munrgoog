in our and other mss3 see n. to 81: most editors change it in the
second, where it appearsto me in place, while in 324 rupea or a similar
word is required: saco adri pondere seems to me not to refer to the wind,
but to the rocks, ‘rolling them over off their equilibrium’: with this use
comp. Lucr. VI 574 ‘recipit prolapsa suas in pondere sedes‘, and my note

where Icite among other passages Petron. 136 ‘anumque pondere sno
deiectam’: to the instantes there given I now add from Stat. Theb. v 37 4

‘instabili procumbens pondere’3 ΧΠ 435 ‘commoto pondere' 3 and 11137
the plur. ‘ponderibus’: but so too our poet below, 346 ‘ ipsa suo decliuia
pondere numquam corpora deripiat': what just precedes this further
illustratas our passage, ‘spiritus ille Qui rupes terramque rotat oet'3
which supports my rupes. With saw sibi referring torapes 'and 346
sao comp. such phrases as that just quoted from Petronius, and ‘sno sibi
gladio huno iugulo',¹ and Oioero's ‘desinant insidiari domi suae cousuli’3
and with the use of inuoluere, Aen. mess ‘siluas armenta uirosque
Inuoluens secum’; 292 ‘oppositis a tergo inuoluitur aris In caput atque
umeros': but ‘euoluens' is perhaps to be read 325 per governs
densa corpora 323 mmmmm is any rech that tries to stay the
spiritus. 327 sipla. actus of a restores the passage: siplae had various ’
uses: but here it denotas a kind of forcing-pump, used as a fite-angius
and for other purposes: among the uigiles there was a datachment
of siphouarii or firemen: Pliny epist x3s (42), speaking of a fire at
N icomedis, ‘nullus usquam in publico sipho, nulla hama, nullum deni·
-que instrumentum ad incendia compescenda' 3 Isid. orig. xx6 9 ‘siphon
uas appellatum, quod aquas 'sufflando fundat...ubi senserint domum
ardere, currunt cum siphonibus plenis aqna et extinguunt incendia sed
et camaras expressis ad superiora aquis emundant’: Pliny hist. 11 166
‘quo spiritu acta et terrae pondere expressa siphonum modo emicat'.
329-357ε what wo see, would be against the hypothesis that the
winde enter by the crater and then are driven out again: thus a still
quiet cloud rests in fine westher high above it, and when an eruption
is not going on, incense is sometimes burned on the very summit: is
however appearances deceive, then it must be from the immense rapidity
with which the winds move, that they elude the sensas: this might be
illustrated by various well-known phenomena 330 Faustus: Lucr.
v1701, oi Eltna, ‘ In summo sunt uertice eninr crateres, ut ipsi Nomini-
tant: nos quod fauces perhibemus et ora', 331 locata ipse: the
summit of nens, or the mouth of the crater. 332 βάρεσι of a makes
the passage as clear as the aether itself. 333 Purp. ostra: to Lucr.
11829 Ι cite from Propertius ‘Poenis tibi purpura fulgeat estris', and
from Oleudian ‘puniceo ostro’. iubar maressa: Priscian quotes hom
Ennius ‘albus iuhar' 3 and in another grammarian we find ‘splendidus
iubar': Luor.1v404 uses iabus of the rising sun: ‘rubrum tremulis
