any positive evidenoe'in favour of his being the author of our poem, the
varicus points I have discussed would ιο my mind rather increase than
diminish the probability. But thereis no such evidence 3 and though
Lucilius might seem to have a eomewhat better claim than any other
single name, yet, as between him aud the whole Roman world, the
chauces must be great against him. ‘Aetna' therefore still remains and
Ι fancy ever will romain the work ‘incerti auctoris'.

Our poem is on the whole singularly unattractive and of meagre

merit enough: the poet seems ιο have been urged to his task not by the
muse, but by a most eonscientious desire to enlighten an ignorant world
on the true causes of the eruptione of Etna and the real nature of the
much misunderstood lava-stone. More than half the poemia taken up
with describing at most vexatious length first the many ways in which
wind and air help ιο rouse the subterranean lires, and then the manner
in which the ‘lapis molaris' is really fused. The first 90 verses are

formal and have a strong twang of the school; the concluding episode of
the Catanian brothers is stiff aud constrained eud quite falle of the
pathos it is intended to produce. Perhaps the best lines in the poem,
as Jacob has remsrked, are aas-269, which touch on a theme suited
to the Roman tone of thought 3 and for similar reasons, hild-598. Aa
Ihave already said, our Cambridge manuscript is my sole inducement
to publish this edition: it seemed ιο me, considering the good age of the
poem, worth while ιο give it ιο the world in an improved shapa Its
attractione are too small to make me care to keep it longer by me and
try to correct more completely its exoeedingly corrupt text Ι give it
therefore to the world well aware how much has yet ιο be done3 how
much, that appears ιο me satisfactory„ will be found defective by intelli·
gent readers As another edition of such a poemia not likely to be
called for, if on subsequent reflexion anything new might occur or
should critios publicly or privately suggest ιο me corrections, Ι might
by and bye add these in the form of au appendix to the present work
One more pointI have here ιο touch uponv As soon asI had be·
gun ιο revise the poem, Ι lcoked about for what might help· my p'ur-
pose. Ascertaining that Professor M. Haupt had written two programs

’ on the poem, I sought of course at once to obtain them. By an un-

lucky accident they were neither in my own library nor in any library
public or private, so far as I could learu, in Cambridge, Oxford or Lon·
don. My booksellers after some delay obtained for me the second one
'of 1859, from which I heve got one brilliant emendation: the earlier
one of 1854 was reported from Berlin and other places as wholly out of
print. It has only just been procured for me after long advertising.
Its importunae I at ‘once recognised; but as Iwas not inclined to re-
model my work, a part of which was already in the printefs hands, Ι
