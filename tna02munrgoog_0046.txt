ios‘i βωμοῦ τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνος. This must have been the headland Φρούριον
mentioned by· Ptolemy v 13 just before Κούριον, and the whole oi* the
small peninsula of Κούριον must hare bean assigned to the worship of
Apollo Hylates: Steph. Byr. Ἀμαμασσός· πόλις Κύπρου ἔν ᾗ τιμᾶται
’Υλότης Ἀπόλλωνι Ἐρύσθεια· πόλις Κύπρου ἔν ᾗ Ἀπόλλων τιμᾶται Ὑλό-

Κύπρου ἐν ᾗ τετίμηται ‘ilde-qr Ἀπόλλων. The conspicuous position of
the peninsula in question must have :riade this name of Apollo well·
known in Alexandrine and Roman times. The name recolis what Pau-
sanias sausseye, speaking oi Magnesia spon Maeander or Lethaeus,
ἔστι δὲ καὶ ταῖς ἐπὶ ποταμῷ Ληθαίῳ Μόγνιρσιν ’Υλοι καλούμενον χωρίον·
ἐνταῦθα Ἀπόλλωνι α’νεῖται σπήλαιον, μεγέθους μὲν ἕνεκα ού πολλοῦ θαύ-
ματος, τό δὲ ἄγαλμα τοῦ Ἀπόλλωνας τό μα’λιοτο α’ρχαῖαντ the similarity
of names and worship would seem to imply some connexion. In pre-
Alexandrine times Cyprus was more than half-bmbarian: when it
. became the chief possession of the Egyptian moun, doubtless Apollo
Hylates, little known to old Grecos, would be celebrated by other Alex·
andrina writers besides Lycophron,-writers now lost but accessible to
our author, who, as we shall osten have occasion to see, was a man of
varied learning.

6 Ι now corne to the Dodone of mss. which cannot be right, as
Apollo had no business there. lt once occurred to me that Dardanus,
in the Roman sense, might bathe right reading: the whole of that coast
tesmed with his sanctuarios: comp. Strabo 618 παρὰ πᾶσαν γαρ δὴ τήν
παραλίαν ταύτην ό Ἀπόλλων ἑκτιτίμηται μέχρι Τενέδου, Σμινθιύς ἢ Κυλ-
λιῖος καλούμενος ἢ Γρυνεύς ἤτινα ἄλλην ἐπωνυμίαν ἔχωνς Statius Theb. 1
699 in the middle of a similar address, ‘Seu Troiam Thymbraeus habes'.
But the true reading I now feel sure is ύαᾶοιιιὲι ‘the daughter of
= Ladon’ :perhaps our author after some poet of Antioch may have used
the form Luam on the analogy of Hesiod's Ἀμφιτρυόνη and similar

female patronymica What has just been said of the poets and writers·

of Alexandria, applies more strongly to those of Antioch and Daphne:
they have perished and deservcdly so no doubt; yet there are many
Ἰ testimonies to show that for six or seven centuries Daphne not only in
splendour and beauty, but in fame as well, had taken the place of
Delphi, as chief sanctuary of Apollo. But it is notin Euripides or

Pindar that we read ot this: we have to go to Philostratus, Galen, Liba· ¹

nius, Ohrysostom, Sonomen‚ Nonum, Justiu Servius and the like. The
origin oi Apollo's worship there is told by Justin xv 41 ‘Seleucus
nouus Antigono hostis accesserat. huius quoque uirtus clara et-origo
