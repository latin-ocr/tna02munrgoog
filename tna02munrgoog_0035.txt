details not mentioned there.

'she volume we now have ie but half the original manuscript: it
commences with quaternion 1x: the quaternione are all marked at the
bottom of the last page of each, rx x x1 x11 x111: then follow 7 leaves of
the next one: the last leaf has its lower hali cut off: it contained nc
doubt the pertrait of the scmrrou our scurram, which has been pilfered by
some unscrupulous collector. Our poem occupiea 33 peges, via the last
two leaves of quaternion x11, the whole of x111, the next six leaves, and
the first pege of the lest imperfect leaf: page one contains the heading
of the poem and 19 verses, the next 31 contain 20 verses each, the last ,
page has 6 verses of the poem and the subscription The lines in this
edition are numbered in the order they come in c which has 645 verses:
the two additional ones in pare reckoned aa supernumeraries a came
into our library with the rest of Bishop More of Ely’s magnificent col·
lection in 1715 3 and is the codex Eliensia cited by Davies in his (licero
denatura: it cannot be later then the leth century 3 and appears to
have been written in England, as soma of the modern poema in itare
concerned with the literary squabbles of this country. Indead Mr
Bradshaw our Librarian thinks it possible that in piece 7 ‘ versus L de
quodam superbo’, the Lis Lantfredus cr Lanfridus, a disciple of Bishop

If this be so, our ms. cannot be earlier than the end of the ldth century:
to me it appears to be earlier. Itis beautifally aad for the age acon
rately written ς the words ere correctly divided, except that, in con-
formity with the ancient pronunciation, the atouics, such as et, qai, ooo,
and the monosyllabic prepositions ere often united with the word that
follows: odero et for odor out, opero madibus for operm madibus, oper
etuentoo for operef uentos, bwluoie olidum for inclusi solidam stand quite
by themselves. There are few contractione, except those which are
common in tha oldest and best codices: thus we often, but by no means
always, meet with the usual abbreviatione of per, pro, prae, que, est,
quod, of the final m, and mm in the middle of words, of -wsr in the pre-
sent passive, and -bue in the dat or abl. plur. Single or rare instances of
di, orus, epit, eir, ririe, arit'tiu (amentia) occur. The spelling is on the
whole very good and I have followed it in all but palpable corruptions:
even beonoc· and malphae I have retained as they may be from the
author: barbarisms like Actiaco, cadero, emeatus, inficior are very rare:
millia is spelt rightly: millia once where the reading is otherwise cor-
rupt: ae is generally correctly given presepe and the like being the
exceptione. With good reason then, as already observed, Ihave noted
its minutest variatione. The manuscript has been corrected throughout,
but at rare intervals‚ by a contemporary haud: c and p, o andr, rt and
