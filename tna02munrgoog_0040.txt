and the Illyrian paeses3 the tyranny of Gaius had not been able
to force him to abendon Gaetulicus, nor the freedmen cf Claudius
made him unfaithful to other friends. Seneca whose letters appear to
have been written in old age, calls him a ‘iuuenis' in contrast with him·
aelf. Butae he must have arrived at years of discretior in 39, when
Gaetulicus perished, he must have passed the age of forty some years

. before Seneca’s death. Seneca speaks of his philosophical testes, and

these are srrfficiently proved by the whole tenonr of their correspondence.
He also calle him ‘my poet' and cites several of his verses3 and in the
79th letter, of which we have already spoken, he alludes to Lucilins'

design of describing Etna in his poem, etrite topic with poets, as Ovid ·

had done after Virgil, Severus after Ovid: ‘aut ego te non noni aut ’
Aetna tibi saliuam mouet: iam cupis grande aliquid et par prioribus
scribere'. This passage implies that Etna was to form an episode in
some poem, as it had done in the Aeneid, the metamorphoses and the
work of Cornelius Severus, and would seem at first sight to oppose the
claime of Lucilius as much as those of Severus But there is this
difference: the poem of Severus was already written, that of Lucilius
was not ; and as his materiale and interest in the subject increased, he
may have chosen to write an independent work on nana. Would then
the age of our poem agree with that oi Lucilinel exactly, Ι think: for Ι
have no doubt it belongs to the silvei· age. When it is freed from the
barbarous rhythms introduced into it by Scaliger, Gorallus, Wernsdorf
and Jacob, its technical style is exactly that of Lucan and other poets
who formed themselves on the model of Ovid 3 and I cannot but think
it was written before Val. Flaccus, Statius and Silius had set the fashion
of slavishly copying Virgil's thoughts and langnage: our poem, small as
its virtues are, is independent enough on the whole in its matter and
manner. That Lucilius was fond of Ovid would appear from Seneca
nat quaeet1v2 2 ‘quare non cum poeta meo iocor et illi Ouidium snum ,
impingo'. It contains however Ι think still more positive evidence of
ite age: · Wernsdorf hae noted that the artificial Triton mentioned in
293 seems to allude to a mechanical contrivance of the ageos Olaudius ;
and he and Jacob allega this aa a certain procf that the poem was not
written before this time. Very likely the poet may allude to this very
machine 3 but this is by no means certain, as I have shewn in my notes
to the passage that similar Tritone, as well as water-organa, are described

by Heron of Alexandria long before. Again the writer, anxious to
illustrate his subject in every way, carefnlly describes all the extinctor
nearly extinct volcanoes he knows, those of the Aeolion islands, Ischia,
and the region between Naples and Cumae which he had himself in-
spected. If then the· ‘Vesaeui Hesperiae letalis apex’ had, when he

wrote, already burst on the astonished world, he could not possibly have
