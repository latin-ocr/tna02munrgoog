favourite, notwithstanding a 0101001 from Markland, inclined even 10
-nnderrate the merit and age of the poem, who declared with'reason that
there was no resemblance between its style and that ef the undoubted
remains of Severus In truth the longest fragment, that of 25 verses on
the death of 010010 preserved by the elder Seneca, has an Ovidian
1010000 and elastioity and easy flow which we look for in vain in any
part of our poem. His fiiend Ovid addresses him aa the ‘uates mag-
norum maxime regum’; and Quintilian, x 1 89, says that, though he
isabetter versifier than poet, yet if the whole 01 his ‘bellum Siculum‘
had been written like 1110 first book, he would have justly claimed
the second place among Roman heroic poete, above Ovid himself.
There is no doubt that the Italian scholar who first assigned the poem
10 8010100, was led 10 (10 so solely through a passage in' the ’19111

0010110 01 Seneca, where heis speaking of his 1110011 Lucilins' intention ⁰

te describe Etna in his poem, ‘huno sollemnem omnibus poetis locum’:
‘quem quominus Ouidius tractaret nihil obstitit quod iam Vergilius
impleuerat: ne Seuerum quidem Cornelium uterque deterruit'. But
the natural meaning 01 Seneoa’s words, 00 Wemsdorf has seon, 1011101
Severus had inserted in his ‘bellum Siculum' a short episode about
Etna, as Virgil bad done in his Aeneid and Ovid in 1110 metamorphoses.
This passage therefore is by no means 10 10100001 his claime, 00 001
poem forms a distinct and complete whole. These very words of
Seneca however led Wernsdorf, and have sines induced Jacob and
many others 10 1110101010 unhesitatingly that Lucilius himself iotha
author: with what trnth 110 have next to examine For the 0010
purpose 01 throwing some light on this question Ihave read through the
whole 01 Seneca’s letters. The results obtained Ihad intended at first
to state at some length3 but I have since come 10 the conclusion that
the matter is not important enough for 11110 ; and I have accordingly
compressed what I have to say into as brief a space as possible.

In his 2101 0010110 Seneca says ‘quod Epicurus amico suo potuit
promittere, hoc tibi promitto, Lucili: habebo apud posteros gratiam,
possum mecum duratura nomina educere’3 and he bas kept his word:
but for Seneca’s writings the name 01 Lucilius would have been unknown
to us. As it 10, we see him in a great variety of aspecta, for to him 010
addressed the whole ef Seneea's letters, the first book 011110 dialogues,
and the seven books of naturales quaestiones, in all much more than
half his extant works From these various sources we learn much about
Lucilius: his cognomen was Iunior, he was procuratores Sicily during
the whole time that Seneca corresponded with him 3 of humble birth he
bad raised himself te this place by his own merita: ‘in medium te pro
tulit ingenii vigor, scriptorum elegantia, clarae 01 nobiles amicitiae’.
He had seen much service, had crossed the Great and Little St Bernard
