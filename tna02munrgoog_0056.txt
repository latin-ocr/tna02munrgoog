οαι· poet follows a stoic: but in Manil. 163 we should surely read ‘Et
moesta magis struxerunt aequora terram’: the sea in clearing itself
straincd off its slime and so helped to build up the dry land: siccato oi
mss and editions has no sense: the best msa have struxerunt, not
rosnarum of editions. 105 tortis in a alone: neither Wernsdorl nor
Jacob adopting it, though Davies de nat deor. p. 204 says ‘tortis rim.
co. quemadmodum diserte representat ms qui fuit in bibliotheca prae·
stantissima Ioannis Mori, nuper Eliensis episcopi’ i. e. our ο. These vsa.
are unintelligible in all mss. but a, and editions have made matters
worse. 106 Exilii: Manil.1 165 ‘orbisque per undas Exiliit'3 Lu·
cilius Iunior ap. Son. „nat quaest. 111 l l ‘Elisus Siculis de lontibus
exilit amnis’. 107 the end of this v. too is only in a: in other mss.
it is wanting, or as in all editions absurdly corrupted. charybdis is
curicus: it may be added to the Greek words he uses in a Greek sense:
comp. Eur. suppl. 501 Olt’ ἥρπασεν χάρυβδις οἰωνοσκόπον Τέθριππον ἅρμα
περιβαλοῦσα χάσματιε Strabo p. 275 Ὀρόντης ἓν τῇ Συρίᾳ καταδῦς εἰς τὰ
μεταξὺ χάσμα Ἀπαμείας καὶ Ἀντιοχείας, d καλοῦσι χάρυβδιν καλ,

110 foll or isit was not so formed at its birth, Neo oola cet, but
was hollowed out by subsequens, though ancient causes, by air within try-
ing to escape or the water eating out a way. causo uetusto is either
the liber ιρίνάιιιο or the lympha perennis. 111 liberast: the air within
roving sreely about, wherever it has space, in trying to escape gradually
forces a way for itself. intro has the same adjectival soree that retro in
140 has, and extro in 457. 113 Edit is pers of &doz for the position
of que see n. to 79: Soaliger's limo for limo, adopted by many, seems
very unsuitable to mollit. 114 a 3rd possible cause: my fiodere for
αιἰῖινο, ‘have fused', is surely better than atcere. 116 docendi...
causas seems to me nearer the msa and tc give a better sense than
docendo...ccaso, as opas causae appears scarcely Latin: thereis akind
ol studied point in οαιιοα-οοαοαο, ‘there is no cause (ie. need or occa-
sion) for explaining the causes, so long as we have the effeot': this kind
ol point is common in our poet and in his age generally: comp. 122
. ‘trahat-contrahat’: and with causo docenda⁸ comp. (lic. de diu. 116 ‘ao
mihi quidem explicandae philosophiae causam adtulit casus grauis ciui-
tatis'. 117 the end of this v. too is perfect only in a: Aldus
comes near to a: γδε omit the words altogether. 119 here too a v. is

surely lost, such as ‘Rursus saepe solet castaque uoragine condi’: comp.
132 ‘praecipiti conduntur flumina terra': the sudden appearance or
disappearance of rivers, even large ones,is more common in lands known
to the poet than in ours: comp. Strabo quoted to 1073 Sen. nat quaest.
111 266 ‘quaedam flumina palam in aliquem specum decidunt etsie ex
oculis auferuntur': aud comp. what follows with what follows in our
poem. 120-122 are very corrupt iu all but a: my alterations
