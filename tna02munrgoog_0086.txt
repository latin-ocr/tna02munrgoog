which this refers, such as ‘matrem ille lebentem': Claudite ‘Nonne
uides ut saeua senex incendis. monstret, Vt trepido genetrix inuncet ore
deosl Erexit formido comam perque omne metullum Fusus in attonito
palluit aere trempr’: or else we must read ‘Tutus uterque pio sub
pondere sufficit illo'. 640 comp. 6011011, etc. cited above, and Pernen.

As I promised in the 10110611011011, Ι append some remarks 011
Professor Haupt's program of 1854: p. 3 he thus emends 51 folL:
Inpius et miles metuentia comminus nstra Prouocat‚ admotis ad territa
sidera signis Prouocat infestus cunctos ed proelia diuos. Iuppiter e
caelo metuit dextramque corusca Armatus flamme cet: ccl 1011110 is,
he says, 0 correction of Eueruinus Wessenberghius: the transposition 01
52 and 53 is his own. e coelo metuit he defends by Propert. v 6 59
‘peter Idalio miratur Caesar ab astrc': tc me the context seems to
require curlo uutuc't: I prefer too the coruscam 01011 mss. P. 4111 60
he reads cd for iu: but with iu bollundum may we not compare such
expressions as Ovid her. 15197 ‘N on mihi respondent ueteres in carmina
uires’, Aen. vn 664 ‘Pila manu saeuosque genurt in belle. dolones’, end
‘in utrumque paratus’l 62 ¹he reads laeuus forsaeuus: I prefer ecueuus3
but both correctione at once occurred 10 1110, und would occur to any
scholar: 1111110 same v. he proposes utrimque seule for utrunque decu.
In 68 he adopts the reading of a 16111 century edition, Amplexu cst
uates for Impellcus uictos: but that is surely rewriting, not correcting:
quc too seems in that cese a most inadequate connecting particle. I
do 1101 000 thet it ie more absurd to picture Parth carried along 111
. the rout of her children, as she attempts 10 relly them, then to
represent the stare ss fighting 011 the side of heaven. P. 511119 he
proposes Ambustum aut or Ambustum cut for Ι upoeitam et. P. 6 111 73
he prefers polulus of Aldus. 76 he reads uatum for rerum. 77 nigro
uiderunt cymiuc for ulprce uiderunt carmine. P. 7 111 80 lie proposes
strauere uoucuu for pocuu strauere: 81 pomo for poeno: I could* un·
derstsnd ‘sollicitant pomis sollicitentque equis' or ‘sollicitant fame.
