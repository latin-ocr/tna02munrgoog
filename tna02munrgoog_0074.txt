and at the same time harah aud obscure: he has said in 4041011 that
1111010110 01010110, if put into a strong fire, is fused more quickly than

iron: but now when it has imbibed th'e flames, there 10 nothing that·
retains more surely (domus tutior) what it has imbihed 3 101 then, 110111
the aetion 01 the 1110, the exterior 10 hard and a bad conductor 01 beat:

in the lire, though at first it was so yielding: my correction here is very
slight. 411 00011111 must mean ‘completely discharges'. 412 Totus-
rohere repeats ‘seruans-fidest': 110 exterioris hard and difficult 10
penetrate, so that it slowly admits fire into its interior, and as slowly
discharges it. 414 eccepto comes easily from coepta 01 mss. and gives
the exact sense required, as consipere 191010, aquam and the like is the
first meaning 01 the word 415 00 Lucr.v1682, 01 Etna, ‘totius

17111 cet. 3 and indeed our author has nottho gift 01 clear expression:

on the length 01 time it takes 101 the 1110 entirely to extinguish ita
substance and semen. 423 pamiae appears 1οε011110 01 42οι a mere
cinder-like substance: 482 ‘leuis et sine pondere pumex': it can hardly
· become apamea in the strict sense; as Dsubeny p. 288 speaks 01 ‘the
entire absence 01 pumice and 01 obsidian' in the lavas of Etna3 and
other observers agree with him.

425-4471 in other places you see such eruptione or traces 01 them,
