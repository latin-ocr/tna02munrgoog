Hiera. In the· old lauguage, when the people adopted Greek words to
their own organs of speech, we find such words as placento, terrendo,
amphora, adapted to the lst decl. from the aecus. of the Greek forms:
this mode of adaptation seems never to h'ave been lost ; thus on oue side
of our poet we find in Virgil and Propertius the nomin. credda instead
