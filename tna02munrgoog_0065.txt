Ι explain by 318-328: ie. the obstacles stir the winde 80 fury, and so
*cause the violent eruption : comp. too 379 ‘mora uelocius urgent’. 281
000180 foed. pac: Tac. hist. 17700010 35 ‘multa pace'. 282 clearly
one 00 more vsa are lost here: probably more than 000. 1 cannot
follow Jacob, who transfers 301 302 before 282, and then has 80 alter
8088 301 and 282: he seems to me 80 100008 the poet’s reasoning and
moreover the subjunctivae 00000008, 0000008, 0808008008 are 8800 inex·
plicable. · 284 800000 01 β 10 undoubtedly true. 285 rigido cet:
comp. my correction 01 182 ‘penitusque 00 erigit ultra': it seems pretty
'clear that Aetna was mentioned in what 10 1008 before 282, aa 80108000
talking 01 880 0001000 ways in which winde may get within the monn-
tain. Lucretius in his brief description 0111800 gives much weight 80
wind 3 but our' poet treats 0118 08 quite inordinate length: he has
already said much about it, and continues 880 subject for another 100
linea 288 acatia 10 880 last gain we· get 1000011, which ends here.
287 18 10 8800 forced to admit from all sides different winda 3 because the
summit is equally exposed to all. 0091808800 no meaning here: 009000·
seems quite necessary, the 00· was absorbed in the following 00000, 00
lost by abbreviation: coyit then passed into 0091808. 288 and then
instead 01 battling, 880 winds join forces and so exart 0 greater power.
289 another possible cause: 80 now speaks 01 and illustratos 880
effect 01 moisture or water in stimulating wind 00 010, which then in its
turn excites something else, in the ease 01 Etna its fires: ‘or else the
clouds and cloudy south drive the winds inward into the mountain:' 808
88000 vss. are very 08000003 and Jacob and 088000 here go much astray,
illustrating from Lucretius what is totally different 290 0 ard
cause: flexere and farentur clearly refer to 00800 at aab. 000. 3 Ι 8000
therefore for 880 syll. wanting written 813 808, as I do not know what
our pcet’s usage would be, perhaps 8000 would be right 3 or again 08,
‘when haply’, might better connect tho v. with what follows: then fleo:
capul is obscure, though the general meaning is clear: ‘or else these
clouds, etc. wheel about and take the winda behind, and 00 drive them
in': in 289 they met· them in frent: fircera capae, 100 flauere aa, seems a
doubtful expression 3 so that perhaps Wernsdorf is right in taking it to
mean have rounded, doubled, the head 01 Etna, comparing 880 technical
⁴ flectere promunturium'‚ ‘flea Leucaten'. 291 uada is the water from
the clouds: then this water presses, drives before it the 0100 and condomas
them with its blows and so increases their force: 7803000800 seems neces-
sary: I do not find 8000000800 10 880 sense 01 ‘streaming' applied 80 aught
but liquida, or speech. 293 now follow two illustratione 10000 0081110101
